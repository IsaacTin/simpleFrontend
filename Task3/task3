While it is true that NodeFlair Jobs give a great amount of useful information, I feel that the amount of information given can be improved one step further.
In my opinion, one way to increase web traffic for Nodeflair Jobs would be to include another category of data into the jobs - the starting salary.
A big factor that many people would consider before applying for any position or role is the salary. 
While some plan to stay in companies in the long run and hence make good use of the information on title changes within the comopany, 
there are many who also plan to simply stay for a short while - maybe two to three years at most- and will definitely be more interested in the salary they will be getting immediately.
This is especially so for interns, where majority would only stay for a few months before leaving the company. Hence, they would be more focused on the short-term gains such as immediate salary.
I understand, however, that some companies may not be willing or able to state their offered salary immediately. However, I think that there should at least be a feature available for companies
who are able to provide the starting salary of their offered role. 
I believe this would make NodeFlair Jobs a more comprehensive and informative platform and hence more useful and attractive for people who are searching for jobs.

Building onto this would be to search and order job offers according to salary range. This would be make searching for a job on the platform much more 
convenient and easy, especially for people who are clear on their ideal salary. If this feature is implemented, job searchers now have another 
method to help narrow down the jobs they are willing to apply for in a quick and efficient manner, saving much time and effort. 
This would make NodeFlair Jobs more attractive as well, which I believe will boost the web traffic of NodeFlair Jobs.
